Average High Temperature Calculator
A simple Python project that calculates the average high temperature for a specified number of days and tracks the number of days where the temperature exceeds the calculated average.

Usage
Input: Users are prompted to enter the number of days for which they want to calculate the average high temperature.

Data Entry: For each day, users input the high temperature, and the program records the data.

Calculation: The program then computes the average high temperature from the provided data.

Analysis: Additionally, the project identifies and reports how many days the temperature surpasses the average.
Example:-

Enter number of days do you want the average of temperature = 5
Enter 1 day high temperature = 80
Enter 2 day high temperature = 85
Enter 3 day high temperature = 78
Enter 4 day high temperature = 90
Enter 5 day high temperature = 88

The average temperature is =  84.2
2 day(s) is higher temperature than the average temperature...
